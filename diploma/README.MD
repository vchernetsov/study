Title: Research and Software Implementation of Methods for Developing Optimisation Models of an

Aircraft Engine Combustion Chamber

Made by: Chernetsov Volodymyr 

Year: 2024

Object of the study: prediction process of an igniter performance.

Subject of the study: methods for quality prediction based on supervised
data.

The purpose of the work: improve the level of automation in predicting
the aircraft engine combustion chamber igniter performance.

Materials, methods, and technical tools are: machine learning methods, deep
learning neural network methods, object-oriented programming, Python 3.8
programming language, a personal computer with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 processor
running the Linux Ubuntu 24.04 operating system.

Results: methods for predicting of the igniter performance have been
developed. The proposed methods are implemented in a library of functions written
in Python, which perform prediction for the igniter. Directions for further
experimental work improvement were defined.

Conclusions: Methods and a software system for automatic prediction of
igniter performance have been developed.

Fields of application are aircraft engine construction and mechanical
engineering.
